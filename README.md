This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in C related to pointer dereferencing.  The core issue highlights the importance of understanding memory management and pointer behavior in C. The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version.  The bug involves modifying a value via a pointer and the unintended consequence of that modification.  Understanding this example can prevent similar issues in your projects.
